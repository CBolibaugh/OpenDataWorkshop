title: "Open Data Workshop"
---

This is the first in a series of ***Applying open practices to our own research*** sessions from EROS, the open research working group in the [Department of Education, University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/education/).

| ***Who is it for?*** Anyone who would like to learn more about the care and sharing their research data. The sessions are aimed at staff and research students. 
| 
| ***What is it about?*** Archiving and sharing of research data is now being expected as a matter of course, but is not always straightforward with important ethical, legal and practical considerations.
| 
| The first half of the workshop reviews epistemological, methodological, legal, and ethical issues in the movement towards open data, and the second introduces a range of tools and resources to help you share data in an ethical and FAIR way. Each session includes time to work on your own research data.
| 


### Topics

➔ When, and why to share data: Ethics, legality & FAIR principles

➔ Privacy and data protection: tools for disclosure review, de-identification and anonymisation

➔ How to implement FAIR data principles by:

-   Ensuring data is human & machine readable\
-   Creating meta-data\
-   Identifying relevant repositories\
-   Assigning a DOI & license

***I want to get involved but can't make it to the workshop.***

Materials from the session will be available on EROS' OSF page: <https://osf.io/qwurf/> and on the [github repository] (https://cbolibaugh.github.io/OpenDataWorkshop/).
