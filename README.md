# Open Data Workshop
Materials from the Open Data Workshop held by EROS at the Department of Education, University of York.

. . .

This is the first in a series of _Applying open practices to our own research_ sessions from **EROS**, our departmental open research working group. 

**When and where?**  Week 0, Tuesday, 21 September, 9:30am-12:00pm, online

**Who is it for?**     
Anyone who would like to learn more about the care and sharing their research data. The sessions are aimed at staff and research students.

**What is it about?**    
Archiving and sharing of research data is now being expected as a matter of course, but is not always straightforward with important ethical, legal and practical considerations.

The first half of the workshop reviews epistemological, methodological, legal, and ethical issues in the movement towards open data, and the second introduces a range of tools and resources to help you share data in an ethical and FAIR way. Each session includes time to work on your own research data.
