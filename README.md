# Open Data Workshop
Materials from the Open Data Workshop held by EROS (Education Researchers for Open Science) at the Department of Education, University of York.

. . .

This is the first in a series of ***Applying open practices to our own
research*** sessions from EROS, our departmental open research working
group.

***When and where?***  Week 0, Tuesday, 21 September, 9:30am-12:00pm, online

***Who is it for?***  Anyone who would like to learn more about the care
and sharing their research data. The sessions are aimed at staff and
research students.

***What is it about?*** Archiving and sharing of research data is now
being expected as a matter of course, but is not always straightforward
with important ethical, legal and practical considerations.

The first half of the workshop reviews epistemological,
methodological, legal, and ethical issues in the movement towards opendata, and the second introduces a range of tools and resources to help you share data in an ethical and FAIR way. Each session includes time to work on your own research data.


### Topics

➔ When, and why to share data: Ethics, legality & FAIR principles

➔ Privacy and data protection: tools for disclosure review,
de-identification and anonymisation

➔ How to implement FAIR data principles by:

* Ensuring data is human & machine readable    
* Creating meta-data    
* Identifying relevant repositories     
* Assigning a DOI & license      

***I want to get involved but can't make it to the workshop.***

Materials from the session will be available on EROS' OSF account:
<https://osf.io/qwurf/> and on the github repository.
